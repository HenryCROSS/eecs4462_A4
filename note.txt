1. The game contains gun sound effects, background music, also a dialogue when fighting with the Boss
2. 3D sound: The Boss' gun sound gets lower when the player gets farther. 2D sound: the background music
3. The reverb will be changed when the Player enters the second room.
4. Modify the boss' gun sound by changing the pitch randomly within a range from 0.2 to 2.0 to make the gun sound different for every shot. Created a list of sound so I can modify the sound easily.
5. The player enters the Boss room, the background music will be changed
6. Using Send and Duck Volume in the Volume Mixer, lowers the volume of the background music to make the boss dialogue can be heard easier.
7. When the player's HP drops, a warning sound occurs; the lower the HP is, the faster and louder the sound will play.
